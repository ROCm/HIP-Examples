# Simple OpenMP hello world example written directly to the HIP interface.

## Requirements
* Installed ROCm 3.9 or newer. See  [ROCm Installation Guide](https://rocmdocs.amd.com/en/latest/Installation_Guide/Installation-Guide.html).

## Windows Requirements
* Set HIP_DIR to the HIP installation location.
* libamdhip64.dll and amd_comgr.dll must be in PATH or in System32.
* Install MS Visual Studio 2019 for C++ development with Optional C++ Clang tools for Windows.
* Ensure libomp.dll from MSVC C++ Clang tools is in PATH (by default, location is C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Tools\Llvm\x64\bin).
* Modify the CMakeLists.txt of this project to the corresponding libomp.lib location.

## How to run this code:

### Using Make on Linux:
* To build and run: `make`.
* To clean the environment: `make clean`.


### Using CMake on Linux:
* To build: `mkdir -p build; cd build; cmake ..; make`
* To run the test: `./test_openmp_helloworld`
* To clean the build environment: `make clean`

### Using CMake on Windows:
* CMake Command: `cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=<HIP_DIR>/bin/clang.exe -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=<HIP_DIR>/bin/clang++.exe`
* To build: `ninja`
* To run the test: `./test_openmp_helloworld`

**Note:** You may override `AMDGPU_TARGETS` in the HIP config file by modifying the CMakeLists.txt.
